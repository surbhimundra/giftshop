                    <span class= "highlight">Instincts</span> was born from a feeling of frustration with the current gift-buying and party-planning experience. While trying
                    to buy meaningful gifts or plan theme parties for our families and friends, we realized that something major was broken:
                    lack of<span class="highlight">personalized touch.</span>Online stores and walk-in stores simply weren't designed for shopping for
                    someone else, let alone the rich and complex experience of choosing and buying a product as a gift for someone you care
                    about.

                    <p>
                    What started out as a desire to overcome the core challenges of gifting, evolved into to the company we are today.
                    Instincts is leading a paradigm shift in commerce with a unique gifting solution that promises to provide gifts and plan
                    parties with that <span class= "highlight">personalized touch</span> to result in an outcome that conform with what you have in your mind: A
                    precious gift for your precious people.
